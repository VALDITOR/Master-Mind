## In Game
###Fundamentals Of The Game
- To win in Mastermind, you must guess the secret combination of colors before running out of attempts.
- To paint a square, select a color by clicking one of the four cells on the left side of the screen and then click the square you want to paint. Remember that you can only paint row by row, which represents your attempts.

![Captura9](https://github.com/VALDITOR/Master-Mind/assets/139993876/0803d3c2-213e-4c40-9f88-4b32f4bfa00c)

- Once you've painted the row, click the CHECK button to check if you've guessed correctly.

![Captura10](https://github.com/VALDITOR/Master-Mind/assets/139993876/005ef1ee-6f7b-459c-9b7e-971971706089)

- The correction will appear on the right side of the board, represented by dots that correspond to each of the cells in the attempt.
- If it turns purple, you have guessed both the color and the position in the row.
- If it turns black, you have guessed the color correctly but not the position in the row.
- If it remains white, it means the color is not in the winning code.

- If you run out of attempts before solving the combination, you will lose.

## Errors
- Once you've clicked the CHECK button, you can continue painting the previous squares.
- Sometimes, the fourth checking square in each row may fail and remain blank.
- If you click the CHECK button many times in a row, you can lose without filling the entire board.

## Improvements
- Adding more colors and squares for each difficulty level.
- Correcting the errors mentioned in the previous section.
